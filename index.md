# Summary
I want a PhD to research transportation, specializing in public transportation. Other countries and cities rely heavily on public transportation, Southern California does not. From what I have seen in the news, anytime proposals are brought to increase ridership, pedestrian, or cyclist safety, there is strong opposition. People voice their opinion based on fear, what can be instead of what is, what data shows. Ironically, the United States has a significant portion of its population as being overweight. I think the model to increase the positive opinion on public transportation is to work with a local government and its public transportation department (MTS & NCTD)....

Depending on the region, some non-profit organizations are starting to offer short-distance rides throught the city at a reduced price compared to Uber and Lyft. Bus service do not compete with the newer short-distance rides, they have a scheduled route and are bound by federal laws. The question I think transportation organizations should be asking is "why." I know the challenge many public transit organizations are currently facing is revenue, expenses are increasing at a rate great than revenue. The dichotomy with public transportation is that some regions are thriving whereas others are not, and there is a disparity between how much an organization is receiving in revenue by rider by service. 

Public transportation has great potential, but public perception at the local government must support it to prove the concept at the federal government. It does not take much to realize that Tesla recognizes the potential of ride-services, vehicle ownership keeps increasing and public transportation is more economical. There are many models in public transportation, carpools, sharing vehicles, sharing the cost of maintenance & gas......
