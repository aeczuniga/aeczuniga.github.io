# **TASK 1**
* * * 

## _INTRODUCTION_
**Milestone II** creates a second [index.md] file nested in the responsitory and main branch used in **Milestone I**, incorporating the second **index.md** file into the static webpage. If I delete the **subpage_/** from the url [Milestone II w/subpage_1](https://aeczuniga.github.io/subpage_1/), the webpage defaults to the [index.md] from **Milestone I**. 
With the subpage folder, I can retain the same site, theme, and layout. 

In **Milestone I**, I struggled and missed the deadline, GitHub's documents were not helpful. 

The instructions were not clear and thorough for me, it did not tell me that the purpose of _config.yml is to deploy  respository static webpage, nor did the README.md file from the minimal-master folder mention that. 

I do not remember how I ended up being to complete Milestone I, I remeber struggling, cursing, frustration, and deleting my respository multiple times. What I ended up doing was having the minimal-master folder in a second branch or respository but the deployment files index.md, _config.yml in the main branch or a different respository. 

Since then, I have spent more time attempting **Milestone I**. 

In one attempt, I kekpt the _minimal-master_ folder, `README.md` and `LICENSE` file in the main branch. Creating a secondary branch to deploy to the static webpage, [_config.yml] and [index.md] but that does not work, what I write in the ~index.md~ is not reflecting in the static site. I receive an error code mentionig jerkyll, and something about a rubyfile. 

Ultimately, I ended up fulfilling **Milestone I** by having all my documents in the same branch, {minimal-master} folder, [_config.yml] file, *index.md* file, ***LICENSE*** file, $README.md$ file, and 'picture_name.png'.



## _STEPS from MILESTONE I_

>>```5. select and export a photo as a headshot into the main branch```
