# **TASK 1**
* * * 

### _INTRODUCTION_
**Milestone II** creates a second `index.md` file nested in the responsitory and main branch used in **Milestone I**, incorporating the second `index.md` file into the static webpage. If I delete the `subpage_/` portion from the  in [**Milestone II**](https://aeczuniga.github.io/subpage_1/), the webpage defaults to the `index.md` from **Milestone I**. 

In **Milestone I**, I struggled and missed the deadline, GitHub's documents was not helpful. The instructions were not clear and thorough for me, it did not tell me that the purpose of `_config.yml` is to deploy  the  static webpage, nor did the `README.md` file from the **minimal-master** folder mention that. I do not remember how I was able complete **Milestone I**, I remeber struggling, cursing, feeling frustrated, and deleting my respository multiple times. I was able to complete **Milestone I** by having the **minimal-master** folder in a second branch or respository but the deployment files `index.md`, `_config.yml` in the main branch or a different respository. 

Since then, I have spent more time attempting **Milestone I**. In one attempt, I kept the **minimal-master** folder, `README.md` and `LICENSE` files in the main branch. Creating a secondary branch to deploy to the static webpage with the files `_config.yml` and `index.md` but that did not work, what is written in the `index.md` file is not reflecting in the static site. I receive an error code mentionig jerkyll, and something about a rubyfile. Ultimately, I have completed **Milestone I** by having all my documents in the same branch, **minimal-master** folder, `_config.yml` file, `index.md` file, `LICENSE` file, `README.md` file, and `picture_name.png`.



### _STEPS from MILESTONE I_
    
```
1. Create a respository titled aeczuniga.github.io, selecting an MIT license and creating a README.md file when launching

2. Clone respository on computer using VSCode into a web-based folder like a personal OneDrive

3. Download the [**minimal-master theme folder from GitHub**](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) folder as a zip folder, open, and copy all contents into the repository on the computer

4. Compy `index.me`, `_config.yml` files into main branch, out of the name folder

5. Select and export a photo as a headshot into the main branch

6. Utilize `README.md` file from main repository, **not minimal-master folder** , to configure _config.yml (static webpage)

7. Create content for index.md file to deply on static site

8. In VSCode, commit, sync changes, push
```


### _ADDITIONAL RESOURCES_
I tried watching YouTube videos to understand GitHub but it was not very useful. I have spent nearly 20 hours on **Milestone I** and do not feel much better. After finding a way to complete **Milestone I**, I decided to focus on adjusting the visual static site. I was not certain where to begin, I wanted the colummns wider. I used AI during commitments "2_13" to "2_15_2", pushing 12 commitments. I did not achieve the result I wanted, anytime the `index` column became wider, the columns were no longer centered, I wanted to increase column width, reataining the same layout structure. For commitment "2_16_restart", I deleted the **`minimal-master`** folder where changes had been made and replaced it with another `minimal-master` folder from the downloaded zip file from **Milestone I**, like a "fesh start." Nothing really changed that is visible, I kept my static site and what I wrote, removing various attempts by AI and I changing `px` values. Through the various attempts I utilzied AI, I noticed that the layout could be adjust by adding an `_includes` folder to the main brach, separate of the **minimal-master** folder with the theme files. The static site would use the ***head-custom.html*** file from the `_includes` folder in the main branch, bypassing the ***head-custom.html*** file in the **minimal-master** folder. I also tried changing the px values in the **../minimal-master/_sass/jekyll-theme-minimal.scss** folder but that did not have a visible effect on the static webpage.

I did not use any AI help for **Milestone II**.
