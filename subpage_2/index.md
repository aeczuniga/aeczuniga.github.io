This subpage is the README file for a new repository with previous homework assignments on Python.


It is not in your interest to utilize any of the information, there are errors. I am learning. Again, this repository is for homework assignments for Dr. Karimi, California State University of San Marcos. 

New GitHub Repository for homework assignments [github.com/aeczuniga/MSSCA_karimi_assignments](https://github.com/aeczuniga/MSSCA_karimi_assignments)

Main GitHub page [aeczuniga.github.io](https://aeczuniga.github.io/)


# Assignments
**GitHub**

The **first milestone** on GitHub was building a creating an account and deploying a webpage. Viewable by selecting [aeczuniga.github.io (assignment I)](https://aeczuniga.github.io/)

The **second milestone** on GitHub discusses how the first assignment was created and includes a webpage (subpage) within the main webpage. Viewable by selecting [aeczuniga.github.io (assignment II)](https://aeczuniga.github.io/subpage_1/)


**Python**

The **first Python assignment** is data cleaning. Data has null values and columns are not formatted properly. After cleaning and transforming the data, the assignment proceeds with getting relevant information. This assignment is more of an introductory to  data, ensuring it is ready to be analyzed further, primarily focusing on inventory, made to stock (MTS) items.

The **second Python assignment**  continues using the data from the previous assignment. This assignment calculates safety stock for various sevice levels. The assignment begins by calculating aggregated statistics and utilizing the transformed data for calculations. The assignment ends with the  calculated average safety stock for all SKUs and the identification of the SKU with the greatest and smallest amount of safety stock.






# **How I created this webpage**
  
1. Create a respository titled aeczuniga.github.io, selecting an MIT license and creating a README.md file when launching

2. Clone respository on computer using VSCode into a web-based folder like a personal OneDrive

3. Download the [**minimal-master theme folder from GitHub**](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) folder as a zip folder, open, and copy all contents into the repository on the computer

4. Copy `index.me`, `_config.yml` files into main branch, out of the name folder

5. Select and export a photo as a headshot into the main branch

6. Utilize `README.md` file from main repository, not **minimal-master** folder, to configure `_config.yml` (static webpage)

7. Create content for `index.md` file to deply on static site

8. In VSCode, commit, sync changes, push

9. Add a `subpage` folder with an **index.md** file, at the top, containing 
    # ---

10. Add another `subpage` folder for this webpage.
